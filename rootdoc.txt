Snowpark by itself is a powerful library, but still some utility functions can always help.

Installation
We recommended installing using PYPI

    $ pip install snowconvert-deploy-tool --upgrade
note:: If you run this command on MacOS change pip by pip3

Usage
just import it at the top of your file and it will automatically extend your snowpark package. For example:

from snowflake.snowpark import Session
import snowpark_extensions
new_session = Session.builder.from_snowsql().appName("app1").getOrCreate()
